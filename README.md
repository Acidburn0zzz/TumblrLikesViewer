### Current Travis status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jay-to-the-dee/TumblrLikesViewer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jay-to-the-dee/TumblrLikesViewer)

### Requirements
* To get this to work you will need to put your API keys in the Keys.properties file
* Now uses the official Jumblr 0.10 build (a copy of which is included)

### Developing
* Recommended Netbeans 7.4+ for developing (especially for editing some parts of the GUI)
* Also uses Netbeans beans binding library (included)

### Current limitations
* Currently only supports PhotoPost's (as it is the majority of Tumblr after all :P)
* No way of logging on without using Keys.properties (something more elegant is on the TODO list)
* ~~Notes, followers and following menu's are usually too big and go off screen (a way of managing this is needed)~~
* Internationalisation support is implemented but currently patchy - will be cleaned up at a later date
